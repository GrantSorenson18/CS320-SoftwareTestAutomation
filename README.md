A short repo highlighting a calendar application with unit tests

1.How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  While creating a system its important to understand the language your working with and be able to achieve your intended design. A system is only as good as it's design, which is why every system should begin on paper so aspects like
naming convention and a style guide can be agreed on before a single line of code is written. This can be less important for small projects, but will always prove useful because the requirements and functional aspects of the system
are well defined.

2.How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  Interpreting user needs can be difficult if the purpose of the system is obscure or confusing. It's important for the user to experience an intuitive system that has few errors and doesn’t lead them down the wrong path. Things like user stories and use cases can help narrow down the needs of users and propose improved functionality. Furthermore, security is an important user need that cannot go over looked, and things like effective unit tests and automated testing can help with ensuring the system is being tested to the highest standards and no errors are present.
  
3.How do I approach designing software?
  When designing software I think it’s important to have a good idea of what the system will look like and how it will function before a single line of code is written. creating an effective system design doc makes it easier to visualize
the system and fix errors or missing components before a lot of work is already completed. Additionally, its important to create a comprehensive testing plan for the system to ensure no errors or bugs are present within the system.
These are two of the most important aspects that can help developers create more robust and effective system that more closely align to functionality, security, and performance requirements.
